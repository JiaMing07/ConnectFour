Using Upper Confidence Bound Apply to Tree (MCTS + UCB) algorithm.

Before entering the Monte Carlo tree, add judgments on must-win, must-lose, and must-win for the opponent. During the simulation, add judgments on must-win and must-win for the opponent. After doing this, the winning rate is improved compared to random simulation.

More details about the experiments are in report.pdf.
